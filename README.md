#SWAPI Apollo Server Wrapper

A wrapper around [SWAPI](http://swapi.co) built using Apollo Server.  This is intended to be a POC of an express and HAPI GraphQL server.

Uses:

* [graphql-server-express](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-server) - Apollo server GraphQL middleware for express.
* [graphql-server-hapi](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-server) - Apollo server GraphQL plugin for Hapi.
* [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) - a JavaScript GraphQL runtime.
* [DataLoader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader) - for coalescing and caching fetches.
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - for easy exploration of this GraphQL server.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

Build project

```sh
npm run build
```

## Local Server

A local server is in `./src`. It can be run with:

```sh
npm start
```

This is will start both an express server on port 3000 and a HAPI server on port 8000.

You can explore the API at http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:8000

## Development Server

A development server that watches for changes can be ran with:

```sh
npm run dev
```
